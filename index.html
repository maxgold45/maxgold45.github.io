            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>
                I am a senior computer science major and music minor at <a href="https://cs.carleton.edu">Carleton
                    College</a>. After college graduation,
                I hope to work in software development. I love playing piano, listening
                to the blues, and working on random coding projects. <b>This website is a
                    work in progress and will continue to evolve</b>. It is accurate,
                although not all-inclusive.

            <h3>Work:</h3>
            <h4 id="name">PivotalPath: Software Engineering Internship</h4>
            <p id="description">I developed an app which we called the <em>PivotalPath Score Card</em>. Each component
                is created dynamically so that the charts are interactive and change based upon the parameters and
                settings chosen.
                Below you can see two of the many components I developed.
                These were developed using <a href=https://dash.plotly.com />Plotly Dash</a> and data was cleaned using
                the Python <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a> data
                analysis library.
            </p>
            <p id="description">
                The first component is the Return Table.
                This is used to see how a fund performs over time. You can see how it performs monthly, quarterly,
                year
                to date. You can also see the drawdown, which is the peak to trough decline.
            </p>

            </details>
            <p id="description">
                The second component is the
                Z Score graph. With this component, you can see how a fund performs compared to its peer group. A
                peer
                group is a group of funds that are similar to the selected fund. For example, if Microsoft were a
                hedge
                fund, then companies like Apple and Google would be in its peer group. The fund in this graph only
                outperformed its peer group in 2014. Every other year, it underperformed.
            </p>

            <p id="description">Winner of the Spring 2019 <a href="https://devpost.com/software/carl-pool">Carleton
                    College Hackathon</a>.
                A ride-sharing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>
                made for Carleton students who are in need of a ride to the Twin
                Cities or a neighboring town. Built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap),
                Javascript, and Google Sheets. See the project on <a

                id="name">CineHub- A Movie Database:</a>
            <p id="description">This was a month long partner project for my
                Software Design (CS 257) class. CineHub introduced me to a
                multitude of different tools including flask, PostgreSQL, psycopg2,
                AJAX, JSON, REST APIs, and web design. It was previously hosted on
                a Carleton server, but it was taken down after the end of the
                trimester.</p>
            <p id="description">CineHub was basically a simpler representation
                of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a> using a free dataset
                of 5,000 movies from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>
                (I wrote a Kaggle tutorial for the Carleton Library <a
                    href="https://gouldguides.carleton.edu/dataknowledgebase/kaggle">here</a>).</p>

                id="name">Frogger:</a>
            <p id="description">This classic frogger game was made for my Software
                Design (CS 257) final project at Carleton along with a partner. This program is written
                in Java and uses the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>
                design pattern.</p>
            <h4 id="name">Data Cleaning with the Carleton Library:</h4>
            <p id="description">I cleaned and anonymized 10 slightly similar
                CSV files using Google's <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>
                and the Python <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a> data
                analysis library. Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to
                see any of the source code or original files.</p>
