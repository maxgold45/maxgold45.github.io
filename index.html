        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>
        I'm a junior computer science major and music minor at <a href =
        "https://cs.carleton.edu">Carleton College</a>. After graduation, I hope
        to work in software development. I love playing piano, listening to the
        blues, and working on random coding projects. This website is a work in
        progress and will continue to evolve, likely at the same rate as my
        recovery from hip surgery.
